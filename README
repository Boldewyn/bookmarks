                        Social Bookmarks for Lone Wolves

There is a famous social-bookmarking service, who had seen better days. This is
an attempt to get independent of it, however remaining in sync.

Bookmarks works like that: Store your bookmarks.  Display them to the world, if
you want.


F E A T U R E S :

* Delicious import and synchronization
* Private bookmarks


U S I N G   A S   D R O P - I N   F O R   D E L I C I O U S :

In your Delicious bookmarklet change the URI from "http://delicious.com/save"
to "http://your.domain/install/path/save" (note the "save"). In the config
file make sure to have these lines included:

    'plugins' => array(
        'active' => array(
            'delicious',
        ),
        'delicious' => array(
            'auth' => base64_encode('delicious_username:delicious_password'),
            'sync' => True,
        ),
    ),

Ready! Your bookmarks are now saved locally, but always synchronized with
Delicious.
